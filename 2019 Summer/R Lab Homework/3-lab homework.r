## R Lab Homework 3

## Follow these stylistic conventions
## 1. Have your own system of variable naming, and stick to it. I will be looking for consistency.
## 2. Use a single hashtag # for your comments. I will use ## for my comments.
## Use spaces carefully to organize your code. Make it readable. You can use hashtags to add headings and comments to your code.

## Compute the mean of each variable using the "slow way."
#exam1 mean
sum.of.scores <- sum(class.data$exam1)
sum.of.scores
n <- length(class.data$exam1)
n
slow.mean <- sum.of.scores / n
slow.mean

#exam2 mean
sum.of.scores2 <- sum(class.data$exam2)
sum.of.scores
n <- length(class.data$exam2)
n
slow.mean2 <- sum.of.scores2 / n
slow.mean2


## Compute the mean of each variable either using the super fast or the extra super fast ways.
#superfast mean exam1
mean(class.data$exam1)

#superfast mean exam2
mean(class.data$exam2)


## Compute the median of each of the two variables in the data frame using "slow way."
#median exam1
sortede.values <- sort(class.data$exam1)
sortede.values[n/2]

#median exam2
sortede.values <-(class.data$exam2)
sortede.values[n/2]



## Compute the median of each of the two variables in the data frame using "fast way."


## Compute the mode of each of the two variables in the data frame using the only way we learned.


## Generate a histogram for each of the variables, and describe their shape using concept from Chapter 5 (skewness, kurtosis, normality). 
## Add your comments as hashtags


## Generate a boxplot for each of the variables


## Save your work as an R script file, and upload it to Moodle.
